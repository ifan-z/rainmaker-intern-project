# Rainmaker Intern Project

### Overview:

This repository is a bare bones TypeScript project for calculating slippage on a DEX trade. It's intended to exercise and evaluate usage of ethers, TypeScript, Ethereum contracts, and related components.

### Objective:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Update `index.ts` and follow along with the comments to implement a swap/slippage estimator.
3. Commit your changes and share the results with us.

### Tips:

- As with much of blockchain coding, this project doesn't require much code to accomplish the goal. It's mostly an exercise of reading documentation and understanding how to use the tools available.
- ChatGPT can probably solve most of this project for you, but that kinda defeats the purpose. If you want to use it for inspiration, go nuts, but we intend to ask some followup questions and it'll be important that you know what your code does.
- If you get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out for help! Push your progress and reach out. Let's collaborate.
